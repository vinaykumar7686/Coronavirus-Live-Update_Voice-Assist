In this project I will be using Web Scraping through API to gather live data regarding coronavirus. API returns me JSON format file as response.
Which will be further processed in order to provide the user with requested information.
User will be able to interact with the application through voice commands.
In later part of my projet I'll implement Machine Learning Algorithm on the local dataset, to predict the sitution of next few days.
